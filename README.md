# Macro Fit

The excuses for ignoring our health are boundless. The two most common to be encountered are:

* Lack of Time
* Lack of Know How

With this app we are looking to solve just that. With the ability to put the power of a trainer 
within the palm of your hand. 


## Overview

**Calorie - Macro Counts:**

* Upon login the client will have there daily calorie and macro information calculated and stored
* These calculations are based directly off of there body composition, age and activity level
* Allows the client to easily navigate how many calories they should be consuming:
    - caloric deficit based on activity level and fitness goals
    - macro ratios based on fitness goals
    - macro breakdown in to protein, carbs, and fat grams



**Workout Routine:**

* Workout routines are based on time frame breakdown:
    - Full-body routine can be completed 2 to 3 days a week
    - Upper body & Lower body routine can be complete 2 to 4 days a week
    - Muscle groups routine can completed in 6 days or extended to encompass
        3 or 4 muscle groups per week 
* Each routine will provide info including the exercises, equipment, sets, reps, and type of exercise


### Technologies

**Macro Fit** is a `node` & `express` server based app. 

* It utilizes the MVC `model/view/controller` format for better application handling.
* NPM packages included:
    - `express` - server
    - `express-handlebars` - used to dynamically produce the multiple views
    - `sequelize` - simplified pulling info from database
    - `mysql2` - sequelize and mysql call assistance
    - `dotenv` - config protection
* New technologies:
    - MySQL stored procedures
    - password encryption for added security
    - handle multiple simultaneously through the database
* `mocha` and `chai` for testing
* `eslint` for standardized writing


## Installation

Npm install all necessary packages. Add own database connection into `config.json` or connect 
and deploy from `heroku` utilizing their built in database `jaws_db`


### Instruction

1. Create a GitHub repo called `projectfitness` and clone it to your computer.

2. Make a package.json file by running `npm init` from the command line.

3. Install the Express npm package: `npm install express`.

4. Create a server.js file.

5. Install the Handlebars npm package: `npm install express-handlebars`.

6. Install MySQL npm package: `npm install mysql`.

7. Require the following npm packages inside of the server.js file:
   * express

#### DB Setup

1. Inside your `burger` directory, create a folder named `db`.

2. In the `db` folder, create a file named `schema.sql`. Write SQL queries this file that do the following:

   * Create the `burgers_db`.
   * Switch to or use the `burgers_db`.
   * Create a `burgers` table with these fields:
     * **id**: an auto incrementing int that serves as the primary key.
     * **burger_name**: a string.
     * **devoured**: a boolean.

3. Still in the `db` folder, create a `seeds.sql` file. In this file, write insert queries to populate the `burgers` table with at least three entries.

4. Run the `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` files into the mysql server from the command line

5. Now you're going to run these SQL files.

   * Make sure you're in the `db` folder of your app.

   * Start MySQL command line tool and login: `mysql -u root -p`.

   * With the `mysql>` command line tool running, enter the command `source schema.sql`. This will run your schema file and all of the queries in it -- in other words, you'll be creating your database.

   * Now insert the entries you defined in `seeds.sql` by running the file: `source seeds.sql`.

   * Close out of the MySQL command line tool: `exit`.

#### Config Setup

1. Inside your `burger` directory, create a folder named `config`.

2. Create a `connection.js` file inside `config` directory.

   * Inside the `connection.js` file, setup the code to connect Node to MySQL.

   * Export the connection.

3. Create an `orm.js` file inside `config` directory.

   * Import (require) `connection.js` into `orm.js`

   * In the `orm.js` file, create the methods that will execute the necessary MySQL commands in the controllers. These are the methods you will need to use in order to retrieve and store data in your database.

     * `selectAll()`
     * `insertOne()`
     * `updateOne()`

   * Export the ORM object in `module.exports`.

#### Model setup

* Inside your `burger` directory, create a folder named `models`.

  * In `models`, make a `burger.js` file.

    * Inside `burger.js`, import `orm.js` into `burger.js`

    * Also inside `burger.js`, create the code that will call the ORM functions using burger specific input for the ORM.

    * Export at the end of the `burger.js` file.

#### Controller setup

1. Inside your `burger` directory, create a folder named `controllers`.

2. In `controllers`, create the `burgers_controller.js` file.

3. Inside the `burgers_controller.js` file, import the following:

   * Express
   * `burger.js`

4. Create the `router` for the app, and export the `router` at the end of your file.

#### View setup

1. Inside your `burger` directory, create a folder named `views`.

   * Create the `index.handlebars` file inside `views` directory.

   * Create the `layouts` directory inside `views` directory.

     * Create the `main.handlebars` file inside `layouts` directory.

     * Setup the `main.handlebars` file so it's able to be used by Handlebars.

     * Setup the `index.handlebars` to have the template that Handlebars can render onto.

     * Create a button in `index.handlebars` that will submit the user input into the database.

#### Directory structure

All the recommended files and directories from the steps above should look like the following structure:

```
.
├── config
│   ├── connection.js
│   └── orm.js
│ 
├── controllers
│   └── burgers_controller.js
